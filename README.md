First attempt

Hello,

 Im a 28 year old who has been a locksmith for pretty much my entire life. IOve been doing it since i was 12 years old. I started out at a family business and eventually got job offers in two different cities. Currently i am in Colorado, and im realizing more and more that im just not happy with this job. I've always loved messing with computer and electroics and started looking into messing with the programming on mobile phoines a few years ago. I regularly rooted and jailbroke phones using tools supplied by others and after a while i decided to look into coding and see if i would like it. a little over a year ago i took a coding class and liked the challenges that i faced (even though im sure they were minor since i was just learning the basics) unfortunately i dont have the ability to continue going to  classes to learn so i have decided i will attempt to teach myself. Well here goes nothing 
 
 Cheers,
 Richard
